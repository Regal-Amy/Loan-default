Situation
A financial institution is facing an increasing number of loan defaults, impacting profitability and risk management.

Question
The institution suspects that income levels and credit history may be key drivers of loan defaults, but other potential factors could also be influencing defaults.

Answer
The analysis revealed that income levels and poor credit history are significant factors contributing to loan defaults, particularly among younger borrowers. Additionally, high debt-to-income ratios and the absence of collateral also play a role. To mitigate this, the institution should implement stricter credit checks for high-risk borrowers, offer tailored loan products for low-income customers, and introduce financial literacy programs. Developing proactive risk management strategies and offering loan restructuring options will help reduce defaults and improve overall loan performance.
